# BraTS-2023
In this project we used machine learning to model to segment parts of Brain tumor in MRI images from BraTS 2023 competition dataset. For this purpose we used nnUNet model which supports 2D and 3D convolution algorithms with many different features such as deep supervision, ensembling, data augmentation, etc.
